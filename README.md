# STAT 545B ASSIGNMENT B3
**Cynthia Chung**

## Description âœ¨
This is an assignment for the STAT 545B course at the University of British Columbia. The aim is to familiarize students with how to create and deploy a Shiny application.

## Shiny Application Details ðŸ’Œ
The purpose of this application is to allow users to visualize and interactive with happiness scores from the World Happiness Project. The World Happiness Project derives their happiness scores via life evaluations from the Gallup World Poll. The following excerpt was pulled from their 2022 report: 

> The Gallup World Poll, which remains the principal source of data in this report, asks respondents to evaluate their current life as a whole using the mental image of a ladder, with the best possible life for
them as a 10 and worst possible as a 0. Each respondent provides a numerical response on this scale, referred to as the Cantril ladder. Typically, around 1,000 responses are gathered annually for each country. Weights are used to construct population-representative national averages for each year in each country. We base our national happiness rankings on a three-year average, thereby increasing the sample size to provide more precise estimates.
